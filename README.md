# -- About --

- I am an incoming Computer Science PhD student for Fall 2025 at the [Bellini College of Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity and Computing](https://www.usf.edu/ai-cybersecurity-computing/) at the University of South Florida ([USF](https://www.usf.edu)).
- I will be a member of The Engaging Computing Design ([EnCoDe](https://encoderesearchlab.org)) Research Lab, led by [Dr. Julia Woodward](https://juliawoodward.wordpress.com/about-me/).
- I am highly interested in Human-Computer Interaction ([HCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human–computer_interaction)), Virtual Reality ([VR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality)), Augmented Reality ([AR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality)), and Extended Reality ([XR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_reality)).
